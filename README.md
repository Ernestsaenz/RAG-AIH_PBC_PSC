# Hepatology RAG System: AI-Assisted Consultation for Autoimmune Liver Diseases

A research implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for evidence-based consultation on Autoimmune Liver Diseases (AILD), including Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH), Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC), and Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC).

## üìã Overview

This repository contains the code artifacts from our research on specialized clinical RAG systems designed to assist hepatologists and gastroenterologists with evidence-based information about autoimmune liver diseases. The system integrates clinical guidelines from major hepatology authorities including:

- European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL)
- American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)
- Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (AWMF)
- Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL)
- British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG)

The implementation represents a novel approach to clinical decision support through the integration of state-of-the-art language models and vector retrieval technology.

## üî¨ Technical Implementation

### Key Components

1. **RAG Architecture**: Combines specialized hepatology knowledge retrieval with advanced language model capabilities
2. **Vector Database**: Utilizes dense retrieval for efficient semantic search of clinical guidelines
3. **Language Model**: Employs a state-of-the-art large language model to generate high-quality, clinically accurate responses
4. **API Backend**: Provides a responsive API interface for research and evaluation purposes
5. **Document Processing**: Implements sophisticated handling of medical guideline documents

### System Design

The system follows an enhanced RAG pattern:
1. Clinical queries are processed through a specialized interface
2. Relevant medical guideline content is retrieved from the vector database
3. Retrieved context and the original query are passed to the language model with a specialized clinical prompt
4. The model generates a comprehensive, evidence-based response
5. Responses are evaluated for clinical accuracy and relevance

## üîç Research Applications

This system was developed to investigate:

- The efficacy of RAG systems in specialized clinical domains
- Methods for improving retrieval and generation quality for medical content
- Approaches to ensuring clinical accuracy and guideline adherence
- The potential for AI-assisted consultation in hepatology practice

## üìä Component Architecture

### 1. Data Processing Module

The data processor represents a key innovation in:
- Processing clinical guidelines for optimal retrieval
- Implementing intelligent chunking strategies for medical text
- Managing document metadata for improved context retrieval
- Handling the complexities of medical terminology

### 2. Retrieval-Generation Pipeline

The RAG chain architecture:
- Implements specialized vector retrieval for medical guidelines
- Creates a retrieval pipeline optimized for clinical content
- Employs expert prompting strategies for clinical accuracy
- Includes sophisticated error handling for clinical safety

### 3. API Framework

- Provides a research interface for system evaluation
- Manages the lifecycle of the RAG components
- Implements appropriate error handling for clinical applications
- Enables controlled access for research purposes

## üìë Clinical Validation

Our research methodology included validation to ensure:
1. Accurate retrieval of information from clinical guidelines
2. Appropriate integration of evidence from multiple sources
3. Clinically relevant and useful responses
4. Clear attribution to source guidelines when appropriate
